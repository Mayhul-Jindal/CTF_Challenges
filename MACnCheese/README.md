Well mr.ramen told me to get some information about the cctv camera in some market but neither did he gave me clear instructions for the market nor did he gave me clarity on what was the information needed. He just gave me a link and said trust me you can do find it :/

I guess the flag is closest mac-address to the cctv camera.
